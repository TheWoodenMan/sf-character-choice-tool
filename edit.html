      <h1>Background</h1>

      <p>
        Dwarves are a stocky race, roughly a foot shorter than humans, with broad, heavy frames. Dwarves trace their heritage to the missing planet of Golarion, yet for them, this is not merely a matter of history, but identity—they were forged in the furnace of Golarion’s subterranean passages, and many dwarves born long after the planet’s disappearance still feel the sting of its loss, kept alive in dwarven song and legend. Dwarven history also claims that they once had a different racial god, Torag, who left his worshipers in the hands of his brother Angradd during the Gap so he could stand guard over Golarion, wherever it is now.

    <h1>Racial Abilities</h1>
    <section class="stats-bottom feats-section">
      
      <h2>Darkvision</h2>
      <p>
        Dwarves can see up to 60 feet in the dark.
      </p>
      <h2>Slow but Steady</h2>
      <p>
        Dwarves have a land speed of 20 feet, which is never modified when they are encumbered or wearing heavy armor. They also gain a +2 racial bonus to saving throws against poisons, spells, and spell-like abilities, and when standing on the ground they gain a +4 racial bonus to their KAC against bull rush and trip combat maneuvers.

    <section class="stats-bottom feats-section">
      <h2>Stonecunning</h2>
      <p>
        Dwarves gain a +2 bonus to Perception checks to notice unusual stonework, such as traps and hidden doors located in stone walls or floors. They receive a check to notice such features whenever they pass within 10 feet of them, whether or not they are actively looking.
      </p>
      <h2>Traditional Enemies</h2>
      <p>
        Dwarves still train to fight their ancient enemies. A dwarf gains a +1 racial bonus to attack rolls against a creature with the goblinoid or orc subtype and a +4 racial bonus to AC against an attack from a creature with the giant subtype.
      </p>
      <h2>Weapon Familiarity</h2>
      <p>
        Dwarves are proficient with basic and advanced melee weapons and gain specialization with those weapons at 3rd level.
