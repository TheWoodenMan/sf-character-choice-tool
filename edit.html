      <h1>Background</h1>

      <p>
        Halflings are a common race in the Pact Worlds and their colonies, having spread nearly as far as humans. Popular legend even claims that halflings were among the first humanoids to spread beyond Golarion and into the stars to colonize new worlds. Once thought of as a people without a homeland, halflings have peppered the void with colonies, and halfling caravan fleets—dozens of ships from as many different makes and eras—ply the trade lanes, eager to see new sights, swap stories, and trade strange and foreign goods. Their small stature and tendency to wander make halflings popular targets for raiders and conquerors, but time and again the tenacious race has rebounded from harsh challenges thanks to their cooperation, optimism, and what seems to be a racial gift for subterfuge.
