# Starfinder Character ChoiceTool

a tool that provides a basic overview of each race, class and theme in the starfinder ttrpg to aid character creation

## Background

My players found the initial race, class and theme choices in Starfinder a little overwhelming, 
this tool is designed to signpost players to the race, theme and class they want, 
quickly and with only a bare summary of the rules.

# Other Tools

If you need encyclopedic rules details, best to go to Archives of Nethys - a source of info for all paizo's different worlds (Appreciated!)
https://aonsrd.com/

If you want to create a detailed character sheet exportable to json and up to date with all the options - go to hephaistos 
https://hephaistos.azurewebsites.net/



After that they can head over to archives for a deep dive on the info (linked on each page)

Or go make a character sheet at Hephaistos

## Tech Used

HTML/CSS/Javascript

The site is made with very basic javascript and HTML, essentially it is 30+ sites all hidden, but individually revealed
one by one as needed by the user selector.

I put links to a few of the best class overview videos on youtube:

The Digital Dungeon Master for great core/legacy overviews for races.
and QueueTimes who cover some of the more weird stuff, both definitely appreciated.

I would prefer to put art in all the thumbnails but I didn't want to fall foul of breaching community use or copywrite.
Keen to hear any feedback on that interpretation, open source or similar options if anyone can let me know please do.
Placeholders look rough and it looks so much better with real art.

Thanks to Nachtrose for the mystery-men placeholders :) https://github.com/Nachtrose

## Lessons Learned 

Getting the data for the race information was a manual copy/paste grind - subsequently I haven't finished it and there are a few obscure races still to do

The site has some media queries but requires further finesse at the mobile level. 

There are no doubt many optimisations possible with this site, it was one of the first I ever made with javascript and I look forward to going back to it with fresh eyes.

I would also prefer to scrape the data rather than manually enter it all - but it would be complicated and possibly break terms of service. so manual it is!
