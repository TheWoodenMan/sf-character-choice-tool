# sf-character-choice-tool

a tool that provides a basic overview of each race, class and theme in the starfinder ttrpg to aid character creation

---

If you need encyclopedic rules details, best to go to Archives of Nethys - a source of info for all paizo's different worlds (Thanks!)
https://aonsrd.com/

If you want to create a detailed character sheet exportable to json and up to date with all the options - go to hephaistos 
https://hephaistos.azurewebsites.net/

My players found the initial race, class and theme choices in Starfinder a little overwhelming, 
this tool is designed to signpost players to the race, theme and class they want, 
quickly and with only a bare summary of the rules.

After that they can head over to archives for a deep dive on the info (linked on each page)

Or go make a character sheet at Hephaistos

I put links to a few of the best class overview videos on youtube:

The Digital Dungeon Master for great core/legacy overviews for races.
and QueueTimes who cover some of the more weird stuff, both definitely appreciated.

I would prefer to put art in all the thumbnails but I didn't want to fall foul of breaching community use or copywrite.
Keen to hear any feedback on that interpretation, open source or similar options if anyone can let me know please do.
Placeholders look rough and it looks so much better with real art.

Thanks to Nachtrose for the mystery-men placeholders :) https://github.com/Nachtrose
