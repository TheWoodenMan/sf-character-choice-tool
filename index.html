            <h1>Background</h1>
      
            <p>
              Complex technological creations crafted to resemble humans, androids were originally a servitor race, but they have since broken free to form their own society. Unlike ordinary robots or ship AIs, androids do not simply respond according to their programming; rather, they have independent consciousnesses and are animated by souls—a distinction crucial to their generally accepted status as people rather than property.

            <h2>Exceptional Vision</h2>
            <p>Androids have darkvision with a range of 60 feet and low-light vision. See pages 263–264 for more information.</p>
      
            <h2>Flat Affect</h2>
      
            <p>
              Androids find emotions confusing and keep them bottled up. They take a –2 penalty to Sense Motive checks, but the DCs of Sense Motive checks attempted against them increase by 2.
            </p>
      
            <h2>Upgrade Slot</h2>
           
            <p>Androids have a single armor upgrade slot in their bodies. Regardless of whether androids are wearing physical armor, they can use this slot to install any one armor upgrade that could be installed into light armor.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="stats-bottom feats-section">
            <h2>Constructed</h2>
      
            <p>
              For effects targeting creatures by type, androids count as both constructs and humanoids (whichever type allows an ability to affect them for abilities that affect only one type, and whichever is worse for abilities that affect both types). They receive a +2 racial bonus to saving throws against disease, mind-affecting effects, poison, and sleep, unless those effects specifically target constructs. In addition, androids do not breathe or suffer the normal environmental effects of being in a vacuum.

      <p>
        Lashuntas gain the following spell-like abilities: At will: daze, psychokinetic hand 1/day: detect thoughts. See Spell-like Abilities on page 262. The caster level for these effects is equal to the lashunta’s level.

        Dwarves are a stocky race, roughly a foot shorter than humans, with broad, heavy frames. Dwarves trace their heritage to the missing planet of Golarion, yet for them, this is not merely a matter of history, but identity—they were forged in the furnace of Golarion’s subterranean passages, and many dwarves born long after the planet’s disappearance still feel the sting of its loss, kept alive in dwarven song and legend. Dwarven history also claims that they once had a different racial god, Torag, who left his worshipers in the hands of his brother Angradd during the Gap so he could stand guard over Golarion, wherever it is now.

      <p>
        If it’s true that opposites attract, then elves and humans are the best proof. Despite their general distrust of non-elves, many elves find humanity’s passionate energy, dedication to living in the moment, and ability to accomplish so much in their short lives deeply appealing—a flame that burns all the brighter for its brevity. At the same time, many humans are attracted to elves’ lean bodies, elegant style, and centuries of wisdom. Where the two populations interact, half-elves occasionally result.

      <p>
        Halflings are a common race in the Pact Worlds and their colonies, having spread nearly as far as humans. Popular legend even claims that halflings were among the first humanoids to spread beyond Golarion and into the stars to colonize new worlds. Once thought of as a people without a homeland, halflings have peppered the void with colonies, and halfling caravan fleets—dozens of ships from as many different makes and eras—ply the trade lanes, eager to see new sights, swap stories, and trade strange and foreign goods. Their small stature and tendency to wander make halflings popular targets for raiders and conquerors, but time and again the tenacious race has rebounded from harsh challenges thanks to their cooperation, optimism, and what seems to be a racial gift for subterfuge.

              They usually stand a bit taller than humans and have strong,
              muscular builds, with green or gray skin. Many halforcs have
              tusk-like canines protruding from their lower jaws, as well as
              slightly pointed ears and large brows that give them a brooding
              appearance.

        The shapeshifting astrazoans have lived as humans, lashuntas, verthani and many other races for the past few centuries, but their origins are shrouded in mystery.

      <p>
        As a standard action, an astrazoan can physically alter their form to look like any Medium creature, as long as they have seen a similar creature before. They can attempt to either mimic a specific creature or look like a general creature of the chosen type. The astrazoan gains a +10 bonus to Disguise checks to appear as a creature of the type and subtype of the new form. The DC of the astrazoan’s Disguise check is not modified as a result of altering major features or if they disguise themself as an aberration or a humanoid (though the DC is still modified if the astrazoan attempts to disguise themself as a different creature type). The astrazoan can remain in an alternate form indefinitely (or until they take another form).

      <p>
        Bantrids have unusual anatomy. Their lower halves are nothing more than dense organic spheres. Bantrids move by spinning these foot-orbs using hundreds of thousands of cilia on the underside of partial sheaths that cover the orbs. Their upper torsos are stout columns that taper slightly at the top. Bantrids have no heads in the fashion most humanoids do. Instead, their visual and auditory sensors are located in the middle of their torsos, directly under small mouths containing a few teeth made only for chewing fruits and nuts. Bantrids have no noses and, in fact, no sense of smell at all. Near the apex of their torsos, bantrids have a pair of appendages that resemble large, flat hands with several thin fingers. Bantrids’ skin often bears striped coloration along the length of their torsos and across their upper limbs.

          Borais are Medium undead, but they do not gain normal undead immunities.

      <h1>Background</h1>

      <p>
        Borais are an unusual form of corporeal undead. Instead of being a dead body animated by negative energy, a borai has a mostly dead body that retains the smallest sliver of its soul. The two are inexorably bound, as the body draws vitality from the soul while the soul uses the body to remain on the Material Plane. Some borais are the results of partially botched resurrection attempts, either magical or technological, while others were people who were simply too stubborn to fully die when their time came.
      </p>

    <section class="stats-bottom feats-section">
      
      <h2>Darkvision</h2>
      <p>
        Borais can see up to 60 feet in the dark.
      </p>
      <h2>Deathly</h2>
      <p>
        For effects targeting creatures by type, borais count as both humanoids and undead (whichever effect is worse). They are immune to negative energy damage and gain a +1 racial bonus to saving throws against disease, exhaustion, fatigue, mind-affecting effects, paralysis, poison, sleep effects, and stunning.
      </p>
      <h2>Living Shell</h2>
      <p>
        A borai counts as a living creature for the purposes of what can affect him (such as magic healing). If destroyed, a borai can be brought back to his normal undead state by spells (such as raise dead) that restore life to his body as if he were alive.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="stats-bottom feats-section">
      
      <h2>Old Talents</h2>
      <p>
        Borais’ not-quite-dead bodies still have some of their old racial traits. At character creation, a borai selects one of the following races as his original living form and gains the racial trait indicated in parenthesis for the selected race: android (upgrade slot), human (skilled), kasatha (four-armed), lashunta (limited telepathy), shirren (blindsense), vesk (natural weapons), or ysoki (cheek pouches). A GM can, at her discretion, allow a borai to choose another humanoid race, along with an appropriate racial trait. Additionally, when a borai attempts to disguise himself as a member of his selected race, the DC of his Disguise check is not modified as a result of disguising himself as a different creature type.
      </p>
      <h2>Resist Energy Drain</h2>
      <p>
        A borai takes no penalties from energy drain effects, but he can still be destroyed if he accrues more negative levels then he has class levels. After 24 hours, any negative levels a borai has taken are removed without the need for an additional saving throw.

      <h1>Background</h1>

      <p>
        SROs (short for “sentient robotic organisms”) are among the most advanced forms of robots, with internal circuits and positronic brains so complex that they, like androids, attract a soul and develop true artificial intelligence and free will. SROs are most common on Aballon, though they are different from the native anacites. Unlike androids, SROs do not have a unified appearance, and many are at best vaguely humanoid in shape, while others have shapes designed purely to assist in their primary functions.

      <p>
        SROs can see up to 60 feet in the dark.
      </p>
      <h2>Healing Circuit</h2>
      <p>
        In addition to being constructs and thus able to benefit from spells like make whole, SROs count as living creatures for the purposes of magic healing effects that work on living creatures, though the number of Hit Points restored in such cases is halved. A character must use the Engineering skill to perform the tasks of the Medicine skill on SROs. SROs also heal naturally over time as living creatures do, and can benefit from magic or technology that can bring constructs back from the dead, as well as effects that normally can’t (such as raise dead).
      </p>
      
    </section>
    <section class="stats-bottom feats-section">
      
      <h2>Integrated Equipment</h2>
      <p>
        An SRO has an internal, integrated standard datajack and comm unit. If an SRO is helpless, these can be removed or destroyed without damaging the SRO. They can be replaced or upgraded for the normal price of this equipment. An SRO has an additional built-in cybernetic component with an item level no greater than half the SRO’s character level (minimum item level 1). Each time the SRO gains a level, they can swap out this piece of equipment at no additional cost to represent internal reconfigurations. These pieces of equipment don’t count against the systems in which an SRO can install cybernetics.
      </p>
      <h2>Robotic</h2>
      <p>
        SROs are immune to bleed, disease, death effects, poison, nonlethal damage, and sleep effects unless those effects specify they affect constructs. SROs can be affected by effects or spells that normally target only humanoids, but receive a +4 racial bonus to saving throws against such effects. SROs can eat and drink, though they don’t need to, and they must recharge their internal batteries by entering an off-line mode that is similar to sleep for 8 hours every day. SROs do not breathe or suffer the normal environmental effects of being in a vacuum.
